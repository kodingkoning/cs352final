# CS 352: Computer Graphics Final Project

## Elizabeth Koning and Seth Galyon

### Project Overview:

Our project will be a 3D implementation of Frogger written with three.js. The game will respond to user inputs and move the frog accordingly. Collision detection will detect if the frog is hit by a car or jumps on a log. The game ends if the frog is hit by a car or jumps into the water. The setting of the game will be an outdoor space with a frog hopping around.

### Tasks to complete:

- decide on game mechanics
	- grid vs smooth movement for frog
	- keyboard controls
	- camera movement - moved by player or by location of frog
- implement game design
	- model characters
		- cars (in progress by Elizabeth)
		- logs/floating elements
	- create setting
		- background (skybox)
		- water texture
		- other textures
- implement game mechanics
	- add controls for movement
	- add collision detection
	- add scoring

### Assignment requirements to fulfill

- Game that compiles and runs
- Gray box version
- Custom modeling/texture mapping of something
- Three of the listed features:
	- Skybox or environment map
	- Animated character
	- Physics (gravity, collision detection, etc)
	- Picking
- complexity, attractiveness and playability
- programming style

### Assignment requirements that are fulfilled

- Initial game specification
- Listed features (2/4):
	- Camera and object motion
	- Collision Detection
