# CS 352: Computer Graphics Final Project

## Elizabeth Koning and Seth Galyon

### Project Overview:

Our project will be a 3D implementation of Frogger written with three.js. The game will respond to user inputs and move the frog accordingly. Collision detection will detect if the frog is hit by a car or jumps on a log. The game ends if the frog is hit by a car or jumps into the water. The setting of the game will be an outdoor space with a frog hopping around.

### Tasks to complete:

- create initial structure of project (from existing example)
- decide on game design
	- appearance of frog
	- other elements of scene
	- background of setting
- decide on game mechanics
	- grid vs smooth movement for frog
	- keyboard controls
	- camera movement - moved by player or by location of frog
- implement game design
	- model characters
		- hopping frog
	- create setting
		- background
		- grass texture
		- water texture
		- other textures
- implement game mechanics
	- add controls for movement
	- add collision detection
	- add scoring
